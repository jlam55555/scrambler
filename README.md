# scrambler
A simple Rubik's cube random scrambler. Now featuring multiple implementations and a website!

Check out [the website](http://jlam55555.github.io/scrambler) for a scramble. Screenshot below:

### Inspiration
- Bored on a summer day, with a knowledge of too many programming languages. Decided to experiment with some I don't usually use.

### Features
- Quick and simple: just run and cube!
- Easily run your favorite implementation.

### Specifications
- Returns a 25-move scramble.
- Scramble is formatted in a simple five-row, five-column format.
- Quickly finishes in a tiny fraction of a second.
- Executable files are in the `bin` directory, source files are in the `src` directory.

### How to Run
#### Website (`index.html` et al.)
- Navigate to the URL: http://jlam55555.github.io/scrambler. No experience required!

All of the following will require a basic knowledge of the terminal. First, navigate to the `bin` directory, where the executable (runnable) files are located, and then run the language-specific command:

#### JavaScript (`scrambler.js`)
- Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed.
- Run `nodejs scrambler.js`.

#### Java (`scrambler.java`)
- Make sure you have [Java](http://java.com/en/download/installed8.jsp) installed.
- Run `java scrambler`.

#### Ruby (`scrambler.rb`)
- Make sure you have [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) installed.
- Run `ruby scrambler.rb`.

#### C (`scrambler.c`)
- Make sure you have [C](http://www.cprogramming.com/) installed.
- Run `./scrambler`.

#### Python (`scrambler.py`)
- Make sure you have [Python](https://python.org) installed.
- Run `python scrambler.py`.

### Disclaimer
This is not official competition software; it is only a simple algorithm that I quickly wrote in multiple implementations as an exercise in programming languages. If you notice any bugs, please file it as an issue.
